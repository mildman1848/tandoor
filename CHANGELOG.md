## [1.5.19-automation.2] - 2025-09-23

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL:** Fixed python-ldap build compilation failure that was preventing Docker image builds
- **Build Process:** Consolidated all Python package installations (including requirements.txt) into single RUN instruction before build tools cleanup
- **Dependencies:** Ensured build tools (gcc, musl-dev, openldap-dev, python3-dev) remain available during python-ldap compilation
- **Docker:** Resolved Dockerfile syntax issues with line continuations and multi-stage build process
- **Container Health:** Verified container starts without errors and gunicorn runs properly on port 8080
- **S6 Services:** Confirmed all LinuxServer.io S6 overlay services initialize correctly

### Technical Details
- **python-ldap Issue:** The package requires native compilation with OpenLDAP development headers
- **Root Cause:** Build tools were being cleaned up in separate RUN instruction before python-ldap compilation
- **Solution:** Moved ALL Python package installations (pip, wheel, setuptools_rust, requirements.txt) into the first RUN instruction before `apk del .build-deps`
- **Validation:** Container now builds successfully and starts healthy with all Django authentication features intact

### Added
- Enhanced build pattern documentation for Django + python-ldap projects
- Comprehensive pre-push validation framework in template project
- Django-optimized secrets generation for future projects

### Development
- Updated template with learnings about Python native dependency compilation
- Created build patterns documentation for future reference
- Improved Docker build reliability for complex Python applications

### Dependencies
- Maintained django-auth-ldap==4.6.0 functionality
- Preserved all LDAP authentication capabilities
- No breaking changes to configuration or functionality

### Infrastructure
- LinuxServer.io S6 Overlay v3 compatibility maintained
- All security hardening features preserved
- Container startup time and health checks optimized

### Notes
- This fix resolves the core Docker build failure blocking the project
- All existing LDAP authentication workflows remain unchanged
- Build process is now more resilient for Python applications with native dependencies
